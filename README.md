# Stan for epidemiology [![Contribution](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/wq2012/awesome-diarization/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Welcome! The Stan epidemiology page is meant to serve as a centralized location for all types of work in epidemiology that use the software Stan for Bayesian inference. As a community, we can share our work with each other and learn from each other as well! Anyone can contribute helpful resources, papers, posters or anything else epidemiology-related that makes use of Stan, regardless of the level, through the Stan epidemiology GitHub page.

To ask Stan-related questions, please go to https://discourse.mc-stan.org/. More specifically, we can all use the epidemiology or covid-19 tags to ensure that posts are seen by anyone interested in epidemiology problems as well. See https://discourse.mc-stan.org/tag/epidemiology, https://discourse.mc-stan.org/tag/covid-19
